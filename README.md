The images were acquired using musculoskeletal ultrasonography (SONIMAGE MX1, KONICA MINOLTA, Tokyo, Japan) with an 11-MHz linear probe by three experienced orthopedic surgeons.
The participants lay on a bed with their elbows flexed at 90 degrees. Then, a surgeon moved the gel-applied probe around the medial elbow.
